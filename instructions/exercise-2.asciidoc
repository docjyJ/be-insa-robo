Computing inverse kinematics
============================

Objective
---------
Compute a configuration such that the trunk, left and right feet are in a
desired position given as input.

To do so, you will use numerical optimization

Numerical optimization
----------------------
File +example_scipy.py+ provides some basic examples of optimization problems
and solvers. In those example, the solvers take as input

* a cost function +cost+,
* an initial guess +x0+ (initial value of the optimization variable),
* a callback function, instance of +CallbackLogger+,
* possibly some inequality or equality constraints

and computes a value of the optimization variable that minimizes the cost
function under the constraints.

Exercise 2
----------

Implement a class called +InverseKinematics+ that takes at construction

* a robot,

with members

* +leftFootRefPose+ the desired pose of the left foot,
* +rightFootRefPose+ the desired pose of the right foot,
* +waistRefPose+ the desired pose of the waist.

with methods

* +cost+ that takes as input a configuration vector and that returns a real
  valued cost,
* +solve+ that takes as input an initial configuration and that returns
  a configuration minimizing the pose error.

WARNING: Components 3,4,5,6 in the configuration vector represent a quaternion. The norm
of this sub-vector should remain equal to 1. This should be added as an equality constraint in
the optimization problem.

write your code in file +inverse_kinematics.py+ and test it by running
